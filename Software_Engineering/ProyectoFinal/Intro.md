# What is software engineering?

The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. (IEEE)

## Basic stages at software development

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**
   - In this initial stage, the software development team works closely with stakeholders to understand and document the project's requirements.
   - The goal is to define what the software needs to achieve, its functionality, performance, and other essential features.
   - This phase also involves feasibility studies and risk assessment to ensure the project is viable.

2. **Design:**
   - Once the requirements are clear, the design phase begins.
   - Software architects and designers create high-level and low-level designs.
   - High-level design outlines the overall structure and components of the software, while low-level design delves into specifics like database schemas and algorithms.
   - The design phase also considers factors like user experience (UX) and scalability.

3. **Implementation (Coding):**
   - During this stage, developers write the actual code based on the designs and requirements.
   - Programming languages and tools are used to create the software's functionality.
   - Code should be well-documented and adhere to coding standards to ensure readability and maintainability.

4. **Verification and Testing:**
   - Verification is the process of ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements.
   - Testing is a crucial part of this stage, involving various types of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
   - Defects and bugs are identified and fixed during this phase.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Once the software is thoroughly tested and deemed ready for release, it is deployed to the production environment.
   - This phase involves setting up servers, databases, and configuring the software for real-world usage.
   - Deployment may occur in stages, starting with a smaller group of users and gradually expanding to a larger audience.

6. **Maintenance and Support:**
   - After deployment, the software enters its maintenance phase.
   - Maintenance includes ongoing bug fixes, updates to address security vulnerabilities, and enhancements to add new features or improve existing ones.
   - Customer support and user feedback are essential during this stage to ensure the software continues to meet evolving needs.

employer consistent with the public interest.
3. **PRODUCT** – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional
standards possible.
4. **JUDGMENT** – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. **MANAGEMENT** – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the
management of software development and maintenance.
6. **PROFESSION** – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public
interest.
7. **COLLEAGUES** – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. **SELF** – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote
an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
